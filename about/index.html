            </header>

            <p>I have been a remote full-stack developer for over 7 years. I specialize in Rails but love Elixir as well, am adept with JavaScript and a large variety of JS frameworks including
						React, Ember, Angular. I actually enjoy writting tests and love pair programming. I have worked for a number of high profile clients such as Netflix, Google and Harvard. I understand
						the importance of reliability and shipping well-written and well-tested code quickly.
            I have been a Wall Street options trader (silver and gold), an English teacher, and a motorcycle mechanic. Lately I've been enjoying creating PostgreSQL <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/static/sql-createview.html">views</a> and experimenting to make them as efficient as possible, especially over ActiveRecord queries.
           </p>
           <p>Of course I also need to step away from the computer from time to time... outside of coding I do motorcycle stunts on my <a href="https://youtu.be/1jLTRDY_gB4">dirtbike</a> and my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o0gy-JqgmQ&feature=youtu.be">msx</a>.</p>

            <div class="one-half first">

                <h4>Ruby on Rails</h4>
                <p>Whether adding new functionality, debugging, testing, or making updates, if it's anything to do with RoR I can help.</p>

                <h4>JavaScript</h4>
                <p>JavaScript is fun and I enjoy slinging data around. Well versed in Angular, Vue,Backbone, Knockout, D3, some Node.</p>

                <h4>SQL</h4>
                <p>PostgreSQL and MySQL, I appreciate good architecture. Lately I've been experimenting with PostgreSQL's recursive querying.</p>

                <h4>Project Management and Estimation</h4>
                <p>I like keeping things organized. Estimating is inherently challenging in software, I think I'm improving everyday.</p>

                <h4>E-Commerce</h4>
                <p>I worked on Wall Street for 5 years, I enjoy business and applying that experience to web application development.</p>

                <h4>Client Representation and Consultation</h4>
                <p>Getting to learn about an industry or how a business works is another great benefit to software development. Over the years I have been in constant contact with CEOs and business owners, their success is mine and I love helping to make their passions profitable.</p>
