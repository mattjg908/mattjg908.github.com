            <p>Professionally I am Rails fan, who dables in Python. My current interests are in more functional programming such as <a href="http://elixir-lang.org/">Elixir</a> and <a href="https://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a>. Lately I've been abandoning Rails Active Record queries in favor of creating PostgreSQL <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/static/sql-createview.html">views</a>. I enjoy learning about system adminstration and writting tests for my code, although I often find clients don't want to pay for it. Outside of coding I wrench old motorcycles (pre-1982), mostly British stuff but I like old Yamaha dirtbikes as well.</p>

                <h4>Ruby on Rails</h4>
                <p>Whether adding new functionality, debugging, testing, or making updates, if it's anyting to do with RoR I can help.</p>

                <h4>Project Managemnet and Estimation</h4>
                <p>Projects can get out of hand quickly, I like to help keep things running smoothly like a well-oiled machine.</p>

                <h4>Knowledge Sharing</h4>
                <p>The best thing about this business is constant learning.</p>

                <h4>Client Representation and Consultation</h4>
                <p>Getting to learn about an industry or how a business works is another great benefit to software development. Over the years I have been in constant contact with CEOs and business owners, their success is mine and I love helping to make their passions profitable.</p>
