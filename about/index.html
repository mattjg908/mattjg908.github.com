            </header>

            <p>I have been a remote full-stack developer for over 7 years. I
            specialize in Elixir and Ruby, Phoenix and Rails. I'm an open-source
            contributor and author of Harvard University's <a
              href="https://github.com/berkmancenter/corpusbuilder-ruby-client/blob/master/corpusbuilder-ruby.gemspec#L9">
              CorpusBuilder Ruby
              Client Gem</a>. I enjoy doing test
            driven development, learning new tricks with PostgreSQL,  and I love pair programming. I have worked for a number of high profile clients such as Netflix, Google and Harvard.
            I have been a Wall Street options trader (silver and gold), an
            English teacher, and a motorcycle mechanic. Lately I've been reading
            <a

              Elixir</a>
            and practing speed reading techniques.
           </p>
           <p>Of course I also need to step away from the computer from time to time... outside of coding I do motorcycle stunts on my <a href="https://youtu.be/1jLTRDY_gB4">dirtbike</a>
           and my <a
           href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o0gy-JqgmQ&feature=youtu.be">msx</a>.
           I also repair and restore vintage Japanese minitrucks like the Nissan
           D21 Hardbody and Gen 1 Toyota Tacomas.</p>

            </header>

            <div class="one-half first">

                <h4>Elixir, Phoenix</h4>
                <p>When I interviewed for DockYard, Chris McCord (author of the
                Phoenix framework) was one of the people who interviewed me.
                Over the couple years that I worked there, collaborating with
                the great Elxir team there, I gained exposure to
                Elixir/Phoenix. While Ruby/Rails is like an old friend,
                Elixir/Phoenix is now my preference.</p>

                <h4>Test Driven Development</h4>
                <p>I am a big proponent of TDD and I have fun doing it.</p>

                <h4>SQL</h4>
                <p>PostgreSQL, I appreciate good database design and have fun leveraging
                powerful SQL features that would be laborious/inferior to replicate in
                ORMs.</p>

            </div>

            <div class="one-half last">

                <h4>Ruby, Ruby on Rails</h4>
                <p>Whether adding new functionality, debugging, testing, or making updates, if it's anything to do with RoR I can help.</p>

                <h4>E-Commerce</h4>
                <p>I worked on Wall Street for 5 years, I enjoy business and applying that experience to web application development.</p>

                <h4>Remote development</h4>
                <p>While lots of companies have recently moved to remote work
                environments given the realities of COVID, I've been doing
                remote development for almost a decade and have lots of
                experience and knowledge about how to perform and communicate
                effectively while remote.</p>
