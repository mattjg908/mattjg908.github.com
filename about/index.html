            </header>

            <p>I am a remote developer with 10 years of experience in software,
            specializing in Elixir and Erlang. I'm also pursuing a graduate degree in
            Drexel University's MS of Computer Science program. I'm an open-source
            contributor and author of Harvard University's <a
              href="https://github.com/berkmancenter/corpusbuilder-ruby-client/blob/master/corpusbuilder-ruby.gemspec#L9">
              CorpusBuilder Ruby
              Client Gem</a>. I've also contributed to <a
              href="https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir-lang.github.com/pull/1560">Elixir-Lang</a>,
            and Hex packages like <a
                                    href="https://github.com/jeanparpaillon/elixir-snmp/pull/21">snmp-elixir</a> and <a
              href="https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_examples/pull/222">Nerves</a>. I enjoy doing test
            driven development, learning new tricks with PostgreSQL, and I love pair programming. I have worked for a number of high profile clients such as Netflix, Google and Harvard.
            I have been a Wall Street options trader (silver and gold), an
            English teacher, and a motorcycle mechanic. Lately I've been reading
            <a
              href="https://pragprog.com/titles/lmelixir/testing-elixir">Testing
              Elixir</a>
            and practing speed reading techniques.
           </p>
           <p>Of course I also need to step away from the computer from time to time... outside of coding I do motorcycle stunts on my <a href="https://youtu.be/1jLTRDY_gB4">dirtbike</a>
           and my <a
           href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3o0gy-JqgmQ&feature=youtu.be">msx</a>.
           I also repair and restore vintage Japanese minitrucks like the Nissan
           D21 Hardbody and Gen 1 Toyota Tacomas.</p>

            <div class="one-half first">

                <h4>Elixir, Erlang</h4>
                <p>When I interviewed for DockYard, Chris McCord (author of the
                Phoenix framework) was one of the people who interviewed me.
                Over the couple years that I worked there, collaborating with
                the great Elxir team, I gained exposure to
                Elixir/Phoenix.
                </p>
                <p>
                This experience was improved upon later working
                at Virtual Power Systems where I wrote Erlang and Elixir and developed a prototype of a Nerves
                device which subsequently sold 5,000 units. The device is in use in data centers
                in the Western US, and that project is still under active development and may change
                the face of data centers as we know it.
                </p>
                <p>
                Currently, I work at Erlang Solutions with industry greats such as Francesco Cesarini, Robert
                Virding, and a number of other very talented Elixir and Erlang developers.
                </p>

                <h4>Test Driven Development</h4>
                <p>I am a big proponent of TDD and I have fun doing it.</p>

                <h4>SQL</h4>
                <p>PostgreSQL, I appreciate good database design and have fun leveraging
                powerful SQL features that would be laborious/inferior to replicate in
                ORMs.</p>

                <h4>Ruby, Ruby on Rails</h4>
                <p>Whether adding new functionality, debugging, testing, or making updates, if it's anything to do with RoR I can help.</p>

                <h4>E-Commerce</h4>
                <p>I worked on Wall Street for 5 years, I enjoy business and applying that experience to web application development.</p>

                <h4>Remote development</h4>
                <p>While lots of companies have recently moved to remote work
                environments given the realities of COVID, I've been doing
                remote development for almost a decade and have lots of
                experience and knowledge about how to perform and communicate
                effectively while remote.</p>
